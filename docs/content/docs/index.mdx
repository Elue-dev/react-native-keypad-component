```

Make sure to follow the [React Native Reanimated installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/) for proper setup.

### CLI Tool

For quick scaffolding, you can also use the [React Native Keypad Component CLI](https://github.com/Elue-dev/rn-keypad-cli) to add the source code directly to your project. This makes it even easier than it already is to customize the component to fit your exact needs.

```sh
npx rn-keypad-cli@latest
```

## Basic Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import Keypad from 'react-native-keypad-component';

export default function App() {
  function handlePinEntered(pin) {
    console.log('PIN entered:', pin);
    // Handle PIN validation here
  }

  return <Keypad onPinEntered={handlePinEntered} pinLength={4} />;
}
```
